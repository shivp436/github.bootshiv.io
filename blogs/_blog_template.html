            Watching videos in full screen doesn’t make much sense on the surface, all it does is take up the whole screen and look a bit better.

            When you look deeper into its effects, whenever we are <strong>not</strong> watching videos on full-screen, a part of our brain is into the video while some other part is constantly itching to click on another video in the playlist or open the ad link being displayed.

            These types of distractions mess with our neural links that are associated with the ability to focus and may end up decreasing our concentration by a large rate.
        </p>
        <hr class="main-text-breakers">
        <p class="main-text">
            Watching videos on full screen somewhat resembles watching a movie or reading a book. It involves focusing on a single task for a long period. This has been proven to be beneficial and who doesn’t want better focus?
        </p>
        <hr class="main-text-breakers">
        <p class="main-text">
            So make sure the next time you play a video, it is on full screen and if you cannot control your fingers and are habituated to keep checking what’s on your playlist, you can use this <a class="main-text-link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg">news feed eradicator extension for chrome</a>.
            This will delete all the suggestions on your feed and you will watch only what you wanted to watch and not fall into a rabbit hole of clicking links.
