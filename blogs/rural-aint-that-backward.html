        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                Being lived in a rural area for most of my life, I always used to look down on the villages and the practices there. “What a boring, backward place to be born in” is what I thought about villages.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                Until today morning. When I just wanted to make myself feel better and started to list the things better in a rural area than in the metro-cities.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                You will/may not get any motivation after reading this, but it will surely convince you to visit, if not stay in, the countrysides.

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                They don’t struggle to do this, maybe it’s just in their genes now. Most of the working ones are up by 5 and they are out for work by 7. And they don’t make a big fuss out of waking up early in the morning. It’s not something uncommon here.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="sub-heading-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Have Faith, In The Greater Being</h2>
        </div>


        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                In rural areas, it’s mostly God. But you don’t have to buy this concept, you don’t have to believe in a single greater creature. But always have faith that there is something out there in the vast universe, that created us, and is far more intelligent than us. This will give you enough empathy and humbleness towards the less intelligent beings.

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                Though it’s considered and displayed in Bollywood, villages aren’t that backward. I’ve never seen a man denying to cook or a woman denying to plow the fields merely because of their gender.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                So is the fact that more physical works are taken up by men and women do most of the household. But this division is not done based on only the genders.

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                Almost all of the houses here feed street animals, not intending to pet them but to help them not starve. In return, the dogs guard the boundaries of the house, and cats lookout for any intruders inside it.

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                People maintain the cleanliness around the house with the same effort and interest they do inside the house. Everyone cleans the roads around their own house, thanks to the Never-Appearing Municipal Corporations here.

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                Thanks to the regular power cuts here, they make sure you live in darkness.
                But even if there is electricity all day, there is never a lack of interactions between people here, even during the lockdown.

            <p class="main-text">
                If you are in a metropolitan city, you’ll know that the aunty next door does no more help to you except spreading the rumors of your non-existing dating life. This might not be true if you live in a society like Taarak Mehta’s.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                But that’s not the case in rural areas, you are always welcome to other houses and even the youngest creature in the next house will know what’s cooking in your house for dinner.
