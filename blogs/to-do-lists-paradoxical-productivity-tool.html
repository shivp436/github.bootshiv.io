                Let’s talk about productivity.

            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                We all want to be productive, more today than we were yesterday, and in this quest of being more productive, we are always lost in search of new methods and products to help us or at least give us an outline of what we have to do, to call the day “Productive”.

            <p class="main-text">
                To-Do lists are one such tool, where you track what you have to or want to do, and follow it, crossing off one task at a time. To be more honest, they can be the best productivity tool when used correctly. For me personally, a Calendar is not much different than a to-do list.

                Coming to To-do Lists or task Lists, there have been many approaches, one better than the other, different styles work for a different set of people, that’s why it is a paradoxical productivity tool. And today we are gonna talk about the method I use mostly when I’m not being a lazy-ass hanging to my bedsheet.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                I started using to-do lists about 6 years ago, yeah, when I was in 9th grade, to do my homework. The approach we are going to learn today is what I currently use, after reading a bunch of books and altering it a thousand times.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                You can just start by using the template provided at the bottom of the article.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                We will maintain 3 lists in this approach.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <ol class="main-text main-text-list">
                <li>Master List (Brain Dump)</li>
                <li>Weekly List</li>
                <li>Daily List</li>
            </ol>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                You don't need to start with all three, start with using a daily list and then implement the others.
            </p>

        <div class="sub-heading-box">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Master List:</h2>

        <div class="main-text-box">
            <p class="main-text">
                Your go-to list where you write anything, from a chore that has to be done in two days to a large project that can be done after two months.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                You are literally using it as a brain dump, this way you are clearing your brain empty and allowing new thoughts and ideas to come in.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                Whenever you write a task down, make sure you give it a deadline, a purpose, and be as specific as possible.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                Refine your master list every weekend to see what you can take on this week and delete some of the tasks that seem unimportant and useless now. Your goals can always change, and so should your tasks do. Accept that some of the tasks in this list will never be completed.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                When doing a large project, always break it down into multiple small action chunks that can be done in a short span of time.
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                Anything which cannot be done in a single action can and should be broken down into multiple tasks
            </p>
            <hr class="main-text-breakers">
            <p class="main-text">
                Eg: Study Unit:1 Of Mathematics, Today is much more precise than Study For Exams.

            <ul class="main-text main-text-list">
                <li>Being precise while writing a task down will prevent you from thinking the task is very big and thus you will not procrastinate. Study for exams seems a big task, whereas Study Unit 1 is far easy compared to it.

                You look at your Master List and decide what you want to do this week, based on your schedule and availability. That’s why it is important to always sync in your Calendar and To-do list to make the best out of both.
